# Prediction-of-StudentPerformance
The goal is to create a regression model to forecast student final grade in math “G3” based on the other attributes.
Used UCI’s student performance dataset. The dataset is a recording of student grades in math and language and includes attributes related to student
demographics and school related features.
Dataset source: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/320/student+performance 
                “Data Folder” has “student.zip” which contains  student-mat.csv file. 
Trained  the data using linear regression and step wise linear regression and evaluated using 10 fold cross validation method.
